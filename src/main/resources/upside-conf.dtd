<!-- The upside element defines the configuration of an Upside instance.

    base-url    - the base url of the update sites served by this Upside
                  instance. The servlet container running the Upside instance
                  must be separately configured to expose Upside on this url.

<!-- The site element lists an external update site from which features can be
     included in a federated site.

    name    - name of the site. This is used by Include tags to refer to a
              site.
    url     - the url to a site. This must point to the base directory of
              the site. E.g. "http://foo.bar/update-site/"

<!-- The federated-site defines a "virtual" update site, composed of features
     from one or more external update sites. These are the update sites which
     are served by Upside.

    name    - the name of the federated site. This is used to construct the
              site's url. The url of the federated site will be a combination
              of this name and the base-url. E.g: If name is "updates", the
              full url of the site will be "http://mysite.example.com/updates".

<!-- The include element specifies a set of features to include in a
     federated site. These features can be included directly in a site, or in
     the category of a site. The element comes in three varieties
     1: if only site is defined it will match all features in the specified
        external site
     2: if site and category is defined it will match all features in the
        given category of the external site
     3: if site and feature (an optionally version) is defined it will match
        that specific feature of the external site. The version attribute can
        be used to restrict matching to a specific version of the feature, if
        there are several. TODO: specify version wildcards...

    site            - the name of an external site
    category        - the name of a category in the external site
    feature         - the name of a category in the external site
    version         - the version of a feature in the external site.
    keep-categories - when including a feature from an external site, all the
                      categories that feature is a member of can also be
                      included automatically by setting this to "true". Note
                      that this does not cause other features in those
                      categories to be included.
